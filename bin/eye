#NOTE: this script is a copy of the script included in a system-wide installation of eye v0.8.
# it is reproduced here so that eye can be run on deployment of argo to machines that lack a system-wide
# installation of eye (which is the setup as of this comment's writing).  if you upgrade the version of eye
# that argo uses, check to see whether this needs to be upgraded.

# (text from the original installation)
# This file was generated by RubyGems.
#
# The application 'eye' is installed as part of a gem, and
# this file is here to facilitate running it.
