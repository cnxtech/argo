Description:
    Generate a minimal config for DOR based on the current Rails.env.
    The main purpose of this is to provide Continuous Integration testing a minimal config.
    That is to say, you may need to do more to setup development and production.

    In particular, fedora and solr are expected to be on localhost.

Examples:
    rails generate argo:dor
    rails generate argo:dor my.dev-workflows.com/workflow
    RAILS_ENV=test rails generate argo:dor
    RAILS_ENV=development rails generate argo:dor https://our.workflows.com/workflow

    This will create:
        config/environments/dor_#{Rails.env}.rb
